A group is a non-empty set $G$ together with a binary operation on $G$ ($\cdot$), that fulfills the following axioms:
1. **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, one has $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
2. **Identity element**: There exists an element $e\in G$ such that, for every $a \in G$, $e \cdot a = a$ and $a \cdot e = a$
3. **Inverse element**: For each $a\in G$, there exists a *unique* element $b\in G$ such that $a \cdot b = e$ and $b \cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element. The inverse of $a$ is denoted as $a^{-1}$
