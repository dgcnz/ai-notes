Splits the computation into two steps: [depthwise convolution](https://paperswithcode.com/method/depthwise-convolution) applies a single convolutional filter per each input channel and [pointwise convolution](https://paperswithcode.com/method/pointwise-convolution) is used to create a linear combination of the output of the depthwise convolution.

Related ideas are often used to reduce the size/complexity of convolutional layers. It reduces expressivity of convolutions but its less parameters.
