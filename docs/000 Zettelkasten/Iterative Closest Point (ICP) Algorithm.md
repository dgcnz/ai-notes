- data association (correspondence estimation)
- Transformation estimation

locally optimal solution



Variants:
- robust kernel to give less weight to outliers
- point-to-plane metrics (instead of ponit-to-point) works better for surfaces
For large displacements or outliers, there are better alternatives than ICP
