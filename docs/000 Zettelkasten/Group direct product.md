Given groups $G$ (with operation \*) and $H$ (with operation $\Delta$), the **direct product** $G \times H$ is defined as follows:
1. The underlying set is the Cartesian product, $G \times H$. That is, the ordered pairs $(g, h)$, where $g \in G$ and $h \in H$. 
2. The binary operation on $G \times H$ is defined **component-wise**.
$$ 
(g_1, h_1) \cdot (g_2, h_2) = (g_1 * g_2, h_1 \Delta h_2)
$$

The resulting algebraic object satisfies the [[Group Axioms]].
