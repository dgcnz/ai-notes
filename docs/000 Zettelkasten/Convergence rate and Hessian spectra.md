- Remember: If a Hessian matrix is positive definite everywhere, then the function is convex => bad neg eigenvalues
- Large eigenvalues of the 
Metrics for flatness Some metrics, such as the maximum Hessian eigenvalue, measure the worstcase loss increase under an adversarial perturbation to the weights [10, 16], while other proposed metrics, such as the Hessian trace, measure the expected loss increase under random perturbations to the weights.
