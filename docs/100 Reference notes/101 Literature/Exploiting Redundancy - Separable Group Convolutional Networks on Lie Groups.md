> [!info] Abstract
> In this work, we investigate the properties of representations learned by regular G-CNNs, and show considerable **parameter redundancy** in group convolution kernels. This finding motivates further weight-tying by sharing convolution kernels over subgroups. To this end, we introduce convolution kernels that are **separable** over the subgroup and channel dimensions.

Interesting because it reduces the total parameter count by separating group convolution kernels. This also has a regularisation effect.
