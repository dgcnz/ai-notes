# AI Notes

Hello :)

This website is automatically exported from my Obsidian Vault, where I track the papers and books I read, along with the ideas they evoke. Its purpose is mainly to allow me to share my thoughts and reading interests with people, so feel free to roam around.

Since this project is quite new, there's not so much to read and the organization is lacking, but I hope this grows into something actually useful. There's also a repository at `dgcnz/ai-notes` where you can raise issues or PRs.

The current organization mimicks my Obsidian vault, which is:
- Zettlekasten: small ideas, notes and concepts
- Reference notes: papers/books, authors and affiliations
