# Notes on AI

I've been recently using [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to track the papers I read and distill the ideas they have. This website is automatically exported from my Obsidian Vault, so there are many rough edges but at least it serves as a decent UI for sharing my thoughts to other people.

Feel free to make a PR to add interesting stuff :)
